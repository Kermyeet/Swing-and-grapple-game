# Swing-and-grapple-game
Mini Project for my class Programming of interactive 3D worlds

This simple game is based off of swining physics and using a grappling gun, or spiderman swining esque movement. 

This was made over the course of a few days and achieves its ideal grapple movement through the use of Dani's Tutorials movement and grappling examples.
It is an endless runner that constantly spawns prefabs of level pieces to randomize what the player will through, with particle effects and systems that make up a sky and ground that the player should avoid.
There are multiple UI screens to allow for the player to pause and die, but also makes use of a UI screen that updates the player on their current stats, such as their score and speed.
